SOME NOTE WHILE STUDYING PYTHON FOR MACHINE LEARNING

This is what i have learned.

1. Dictionary :
   1. Accessing Items
   2. Get Items
   3. Check if an key is exist
   4. Change and update the dictionary
   5. Add Items
   6. Remove Items
   7. And using loop for dictionary

2. List
   1. Indexing
   2. Slicing
   3. Changing List
   4. List Functions
   5. List Method
   6. Searching List

3. Function
   1. Lambda Functions
   2. Lambda Functions with Built-In Functions
   3. Recursion Functions
   4. Recursion Functions with List

4. and some logic
   1. Logika Akses (Authentication)
   2. Klasifikasi Data Sensor
   3. Logika Diskon Marketplace
   4. Tantangan "Just-in-Time" (Advanced)
