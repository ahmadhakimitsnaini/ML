# 🧠 Python Logic Exercises

This repository contains a collection of fundamental Python logic exercises. It is designed to demonstrate core programming concepts such as control flow, data filtering, and basic algorithms, which are essential building blocks for software development and AI engineering.

## 🚀 Features & Modules

The `logic.py` script is divided into four practical real-world use cases:

* **Access Logic (Authentication):** Validates user access rights based on their specific roles, distinguishing between 'admin' and 'user' privileges.
* **Sensor Data Classification:** Classifies input temperature values from sensors into distinct statuses such as 'Membeku', 'Normal', 'Panas', or 'Rusak'. 
* **E-Commerce Discount Logic:** Calculates the final payable price by applying a tiered discount system based on the total shopping amount.
* **Just-In-Time Data Filtering:** Separates a list of student grades into 'Lulus' and 'Gagal' categories based on a passing threshold of > 65. It demonstrates the use of both standard loops and advanced Python list comprehensions.
