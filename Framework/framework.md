# 🤖 Python AI & Data Science Foundation

Welcome to my foundational repository for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science! 
As an Information Technology student at Politeknik Negeri Madiun, I created this repository to document my journey in mastering the core Python libraries used in the AI industry.

This project serves as a practical cheat sheet and codebase for data manipulation, machine learning, and deep learning concepts.

## 🗂️ Repository Modules

This repository is divided into four main foundational modules:

### 1. Numerical Operations with NumPy (`numpy.py`)
This script demonstrates the absolute basics of handling numerical data efficiently.
1. * **Array Creation**   : Creating arrays directly from standard Python lists.
2. * **Broadcasting**     : Applying mathematical operations directly to all elements in an array without using loops.
3. * **Basic Statistics** : Calculating essential metrics like the mean, maximum, minimum, and total sum.
4. * **Reshaping**        : Altering the dimensions of data, such as converting a flat array of numbers into a 2x5 matrix.
